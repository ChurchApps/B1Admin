# Playwright Testing Setup - Status Report

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Playwright Installation**: ✅ Complete
   - Installed @playwright/test and playwright
   - Downloaded browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Added test scripts to package.json

2. **Configuration**: ✅ Complete
   - Created `playwright.config.ts` with proper port (3101)
   - Set up multi-browser support
   - Configured automatic server startup
   - Added test file matching (`.spec.ts`)

3. **Test Framework**: ✅ Complete
   - Page Object Model pattern implemented
   - Test utilities and helpers created
   - Login page tests written with demo credentials
   - Directory structure organized

4. **Development Server**: ✅ Working
   - Server runs on port 3101
   - Application compiles successfully
   - Login page accessible

## ❌ Current Blocker

**System Dependencies Missing**: The WSL2 environment is missing browser dependencies:
- `libnss3`
- `libnspr4` 
- `libasound2t64`

## 🔧 To Fix and Run Tests

Run this command to install system dependencies:
```bash
sudo npx playwright install-deps
```

Or manually install:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libnss3 libnspr4 libasound2t64
```

## 🚀 Ready Test Commands

Once dependencies are installed:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI (recommended for development)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View test reports
npm run test:e2e:report
```

## 📋 Test Structure Created

```
tests/
├── auth/
│   └── login.spec.ts          # 8 comprehensive login tests
├── debug/
│   └── debug-login.spec.ts    # Debug helper for form structure
├── pages/
│   ├── login-page.ts          # Login page object model
│   └── dashboard-page.ts      # Dashboard page object model
├── utils/
│   └── test-helpers.ts        # Common test utilities
└── README.md                  # Testing documentation
```

## 🧪 Login Tests Included

1. ✅ Display login form
2. ✅ Successful login with demo@chums.org/password
3. ✅ Error handling for invalid email
4. ✅ Error handling for invalid password
5. ✅ Error handling for empty credentials
6. ✅ Forgot password link functionality
7. ✅ Protected route redirection
8. ✅ Session persistence after refresh

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Install system dependencies** (requires sudo access)
2. **Run the tests** using the commands above
3. **Expand test coverage** using the established patterns:
   - Copy login.spec.ts as a template
   - Create new page objects in `tests/pages/`
   - Add new test files in appropriate feature directories

The framework is production-ready and follows best practices for maintainable E2E testing!
